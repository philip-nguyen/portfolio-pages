      <p class="background">Hello! I'm a <strong>software engineer</strong> 
        with a B.S. in software engineering from <strong>San Jos√© State University</strong>
        and currently working on my M.S. in software engineering as well.
        I expect to graudate in Dec 2021. I have industry experience as 
        a <strong>backend developer</strong> and have worked on numerous projects as a front end developer.
        I am a detail-oriented problem solver that enjoys collaborative environments consisting of
        passionate individuals to make creative and robust solutions.</p>
      <p><strong>When I'm not studying or working</strong>, I'm probably working out, learning guitar, learning a language,
      playing video games, or spending time with friends and family online.</p>
